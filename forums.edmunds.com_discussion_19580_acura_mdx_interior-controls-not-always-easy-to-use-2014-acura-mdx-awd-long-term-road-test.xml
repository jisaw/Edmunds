I traded in a 2012 Honda Pilot EX-L w/RES.  Apparently, the AWD with this package and in this color is difficult to come by in the DFW area at this time.  It was difficult negotiations.  With a trade-in and all the fees it was difficult to get a good comparison among the dealers in the area.  I guess that is part of the game.  MSRP $51,735.  Sale price $47,155.

The sales tax included was $1,525. This doesn't consider the equity in our trade-in but does contemplate reduced sales tax because of the trade-in. Without the trade-in, it would have added another $1,400 on for additional sales tax.</body><username>chebbie</username><date>2014-07-25T15:28:17+00:00</date><body>Chebbie- Thanks.

Did you negotiate the sale price in person or over the internet?</body><username>ram68</username><date>2014-07-25T17:12:36+00:00</date><body>ram68 - It was difficult to get an equal comparison from each dealer for few reasons.  Vandergriff was the only dealer that had the exact vehicle we were looking for.  We were in discussion with another dealer on the FWD and another dealer on an AWD with Tech package (but not Entmt).  Each dealers' fees were a little different and each valued our trade-in differently.  For example, at one point we looked an AWD but in a different color than we wanted.  That dealer's sale price was $48,900 but they were willing to give us more for our trade-in also.  It probably would have ended up being a wash at the end of the day.  The reason we ended up at Vandergriff is because they had the exact one we we're looking for.  Most of the negotiations were done in person at some point with each of the 3 dealers along with some phone and email discussion.  I've never had much success with negotiations via internet &amp; email.  I would say negotiations were probably a little more difficult than what I have experienced on past car purchases, mostly because of a limited number of Acura dealers in the area, smaller supply, and purchase at a time when the new model year is just starting to arrive on dealer lots.</body><username>chebbie</username><date>2014-07-27T13:37:03+00:00</date><body>So 2015 acura does it has car play?</body><username>paulkat</username><date>2014-07-27T13:46:33+00:00</date><body>Doesn't sound like we'll see Car Play until the 2016 or 2017 models.Blurb here.</body><username>stever</username><date>2014-07-31T03:13:07+00:00</date><body>We went looking at 2015 MDX Advanced/ENT AWD today.

I feel much obliged to share my story.Our requirements: Exterior:white and interior:parchment. 2015 MDX FWD with tech package. We bought our MDX from Precision Acura in Princeton for a MSRP of 44K. We got the delivery of the vehicle next day and everything was super smooth.
Breakdown of the process:
Tuesday night I sent out quote request to few car dealers in the tri state area for my requirements.
Wednesday morning and afternoon started negotiating on the phone with almost 10-12 dealers! (tht was v. exhausting). Precision agreed to our offer by EOD, faxed our docs to them on thurs and friday drove the car home.
Also, there were a couple of other dealers who matched the pricing but a little late into the game.
Though it seemed like a couple of days to wrap up a hefty 44K SUV, it was reading and educating my self through forum like this that made it a piece of cakeSuper gratified and enjoying my ride...vroom vroom!</body><username /><date>2014-07-10T13:14:59+00:00</date><body>Welcome to the Edmunds discussion dedicated to 2015 Acura MDX purchase experiences.

Vandergriff was the only dealer that had the exact vehicle we were looking for.  We were in discussion with another dealer on the FWD and another dealer on an AWD with Tech package (but not Entmt).  Each dealers' fees were a little different and each valued our trade-in differently.  For example, at one point we looked an AWD but in a different color than we wanted.  That dealer's sale price was $48,900 but they were willing to give us more for our trade-in also.  It probably would have ended up being a wash at the end of the day.  The reason we ended up at Vandergriff is because they had the exact one we we're looking for.  Most of the negotiations were done in person at some point with each of the 3 dealers along with some phone and email discussion.  I've never had much success with negotiations via internet &amp; email.  I would say negotiations were probably a little more difficult than what I have experienced on past car purchases, mostly because of a limited number of Acura dealers in the area, smaller supply, and purchase at a time when the new model year is just starting to arrive on dealer lots.</body><username>chebbie</username><date>2014-07-27T13:37:03+00:00</date><body>So 2015 acura does it has car play?</body><username>paulkat</username><date>2014-07-27T13:46:33+00:00</date><body>Doesn't sound like we'll see Car Play until the 2016 or 2017 models.Blurb here.</body><username>stever</username><date>2014-07-31T03:13:07+00:00</date><body>We went looking at 2015 MDX Advanced/ENT AWD today.

I leased the vehicle and paid upfront 1st month payment + 3% NC tax ($566), doc fee ($549) and title fee ($74). I declined dealer add ons like paint/interior protection and maintenance packages but I made a mistake of accepting $248 dealer add ons of nitrogen filled tires ($99...what was I thinking?) and wheel locks ($149...could have gotten much cheaper online).

I feel much obliged to share my story.Our requirements: Exterior:white and interior:parchment. 2015 MDX FWD with tech package. We bought our MDX from Precision Acura in Princeton for a MSRP of 44K. We got the delivery of the vehicle next day and everything was super smooth.
Breakdown of the process:
Tuesday night I sent out quote request to few car dealers in the tri state area for my requirements.
Wednesday morning and afternoon started negotiating on the phone with almost 10-12 dealers! (tht was v. exhausting). Precision agreed to our offer by EOD, faxed our docs to them on thurs and friday drove the car home.
Also, there were a couple of other dealers who matched the pricing but a little late into the game.
Though it seemed like a couple of days to wrap up a hefty 44K SUV, it was reading and educating my self through forum like this that made it a piece of cakeSuper gratified and enjoying my ride...vroom vroom!</body></posts></thread>
